RE TOTAL EARTH SYSTEMS REBOOT 

I have been watching hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy a lot lately
The checked around on the web, to find an open source programme to reboot the earth
in case it gets wiped
I could not find any. So I started it here
Note, I do not write code, but I design great systems. So I ll be happy to have smart and enlightened coders joint this project
The first phases of development are devoted to High Level Systems design
I ll post the diagrams here

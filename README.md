RE TOTAL EARTH SYSTEMS REBOOT 
Have been watching a bootleg copy of the Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy a lot lately on youtube, mostly for educational purpose and for inspiration for my long term vision.
Checked around on the web, to find an open source programme to reboot the earth
in case it gets wiped out, which is not that unlikely.
I could not find any. So I started it here.
Note, I do not write (much) code unless I am coerced to do so, but I design great systems. 
When I say Great, I mean Great. 
I ll be happy to have smart and enlightened coders joint this project for the practical part
The first phases of development are devoted to High Level Systems design
I ll post the diagrams and notes here.
May da Force be with us.

NOTE ABOUT STARBORN found myself on this planet as if by chance. I dont feel I belong here, but I know
there are others like me.
